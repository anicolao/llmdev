# Summary: LLM-Assisted Development Insights

*Distilled from 4 case studies: morpheum, diku, dikuclient, DikuMUD*

## Proven Best Practices

These patterns appear across multiple case studies and deliver consistent results:

### 1. Design Before Code
**Seen in:** dikuclient, morpheum, DikuMUD  
**Pattern:** Write design documents before implementation, especially for complex features.

- dikuclient Issue #1 → PR #2: Design doc created comprehensive architecture, all 63 PRs followed blueprint
- morpheum PR #10: Copilot integration designed before coded
- DikuMUD PR #162: "Focus on writing only the design doc... don't implement anything yet"

**Impact:** Prevents rework, gives AI clear specifications, creates living documentation.

**How to apply:**
```
Step 1: Request design doc only (no code)
Step 2: Human reviews and approves
Step 3: Implement in separate PR
```

### 2. Label Everything for Transparency
**Seen in:** dikuclient, DikuMUD, morpheum  
**Pattern:** Explicit labeling of AI-generated work through branch naming and preserved prompts.

- dikuclient: All 63 PRs use `copilot/*` branch naming
- DikuMUD: 93.75% of branches labeled, all PRs preserve original prompts
- morpheum: Consistent bot attribution in commit history

**Impact:** Complete audit trail, easy to learn from past work, builds trust.

**How to apply:**
```bash
git checkout -b copilot/feature-name
# In PR description:
<details>
<summary>Original prompt</summary>
[Your actual prompt here]
</details>
```

### 3. Test-First Development
**Seen in:** dikuclient, DikuMUD, morpheum  
**Pattern:** Add tests alongside or before features.

- dikuclient PR #15: Tests added during consolidation
- DikuMUD: 100+ integration tests validate all changes
- morpheum: 50 → 353 tests during development

**Impact:** Immediate feedback, prevents regressions, enables confident iteration.

**Formula:**
```
Write test → Run (fails) → Implement → Run (passes) → Merge
```

### 4. Specific, Constrained Prompts
**Seen in:** All 4 case studies  
**Pattern:** Prompts with clear constraints and success criteria outperform vague requests.

**Examples:**
- DikuMUD: "Make this fix as small as possible" → surgical changes
- dikuclient PR #54: Problem-Context-Solution structure → 3 commits, <8 hours
- diku Issue #55: "`git grep console` should find nothing" → concrete verification

**Effective prompt structure:**
```markdown
## Problem
[Specific issue with example]

## Context
[Why it matters, what it affects]

## Constraints
["as small as possible", "at most X", "only affect Y"]

## Success Criteria
[How to know it's done]
```

### 5. Plan for Refinement Cycles
**Seen in:** dikuclient, morpheum, DikuMUD  
**Pattern:** Major features need 2-3 follow-up PRs for edge cases.

- dikuclient: PR #3 (foundation) → PRs #6-8 (refinements)
- morpheum: PRs #4-6 (stabilization after foundation)
- DikuMUD: PR #128 (WebSocket) → multiple fixes

**Budget:** For every major feature, plan 2-3 refinement PRs.

**Anti-pattern:** Moving to next feature before current one is stable.

### 6. Rapid Iteration Culture
**Seen in:** All 4 case studies  
**Pattern:** Accept "good enough to iterate" over "perfect before merging."

**Velocities achieved:**
- dikuclient: 3.5 PRs/day for 18 days
- diku: 6 issues/day for 5 days
- DikuMUD: 11 PRs/day for 15 days
- morpheum: 10 PRs in 17 hours

**Enablers:** Fast testing, clear acceptance criteria, [WIP] tags, human oversight.

### 7. Periodic Consolidation
**Seen in:** dikuclient, morpheum, DikuMUD  
**Pattern:** Every 10-15 feature PRs, pause to consolidate.

**What to include:**
- Add tests for existing features
- Update documentation
- Fix flaky tests
- Pay down technical debt
- Create validation tools

**Examples:**
- dikuclient PR #15: "Verify and document barebones implementation"
- DikuMUD PR #122: Comprehensive quest summary documentation
- morpheum: Multiple testing/stabilization phases

**Impact:** Prevents debt accumulation, maintains velocity, creates stable baselines.

## Promising Ideas

These appeared in one project but showed significant impact:

### 1. Interface-First Architecture (morpheum)
**Pattern:** Abstract interfaces enable rapid provider addition.

```typescript
// PR #2: Design interface
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
}

// PR #2: First implementation (1h 16m)
class OpenAIClient implements LLMClient { ... }

// PR #7: Add streaming (1h 18m) - fast because interface existed
interface LLMClient {
  sendStreaming(prompt, callback): Promise<string>;
}
```

**ROI:** 30 min designing interface → 4-5x time savings on subsequent providers.

**When to use:** Multiple implementations expected, variation points identified early.

### 2. Git Bisect for Regressions (DikuMUD)
**Pattern:** Use `git bisect` to find breaking changes automatically.

- DikuMUD PR #132: Found that PR #129 caused quest giver visibility bug
- Codified in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as standard practice

**Impact:** Fast root cause identification even across many commits.

### 3. Validation Tools for Domain Problems (DikuMUD)
**Pattern:** Build tools to check consistency in complex domains.

- DikuMUD PR #119: Zone layout validator using BFS for 3D spatial consistency
- Found 35 geometry errors automatically
- Enabled incremental fixing with validation between each change

**When to use:** Spatial reasoning, complex state validation, multi-file consistency.

### 4. Meta-Documentation (diku)
**Pattern:** Track every prompt used in PROMPTS.md file.

**Benefits:**
- Creates learning artifact
- Shows what worked/didn't work
- Documents decision evolution
- Builds prompt library

**Impact:** Future work benefits from past prompt successes.

### 5. Progressive Enhancement Pattern (morpheum)
**Pattern:** Extend interfaces without breaking existing code.

```typescript
// V1: Core functionality
interface Service { basic(): Promise<Result>; }

// V2: Enhanced (backward compatible)
interface Service {
  basic(): Promise<Result>;
  enhanced?(options): Promise<Result>; // Optional!
}
```

**Impact:** Zero breaking changes across 76 PRs in morpheum.

### 6. Incremental Validation (DikuMUD)
**Pattern:** Fix-validate-fix cycles with explicit checking.

DikuMUD PR #120: "Fix errors one by one, checking each time" (34→32→30→9→0 errors)

**Impact:** Tracks progress objectively, prevents regression, builds confidence.

### 7. Checklists for Complex Work (All studies)
**Pattern:** Include task checklists in PR descriptions.

```markdown
- [x] Explore repository
- [x] Run existing tests
- [x] Implement fix
- [x] Add new tests
- [x] Update documentation
```

**Benefits:** Shows progress, enables resume after interruptions, helps AI stay organized.

## Quick Reference

## Metrics That Matter

**Proven successful ranges:**
- **Velocity:** 3-11 PRs/day sustained for weeks
- **Iteration:** 1-3 commits for 80% of PRs (well-scoped work)
- **Test coverage:** Growing alongside features (not lagging)
- **Consolidation:** Every 10-15 feature PRs

## Common Pitfalls

❌ Vague prompts without constraints  
❌ Skipping design for complex features  
❌ Moving on before feature is stable  
❌ Ignoring flaky tests  
❌ No validation between iterations  
❌ Hidden AI usage (no transparency)

## What Works Universally

Across all 4 case studies, these practices delivered:

1. **Specific prompts with constraints** → Better AI output
2. **Tests alongside features** → Confident iteration
3. **Transparent labeling** → Traceable decisions
4. **Design before complex features** → Less rework
5. **Rapid iteration with validation** → Sustainable velocity
6. **Human strategic oversight** → Quality maintenance
7. **Periodic consolidation** → Debt prevention
