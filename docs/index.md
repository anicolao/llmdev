## The Methodology

This site teaches a proven approach for AI-assisted development:

1. **Foundation First**: Use AI to create README + VISION (1 hour)
2. **Tiny MVP**: Have AI build minimal working kernel (2-4 hours)
3. **Rapid Iteration**: Add features incrementally with specific prompts
4. **Regular Consolidation**: Maintain quality every 10-15 PRs

**Results**: 3-11 PRs/day, 1-3 commits per PR, production-ready in weeks

## Why This Works

Every practice on this site is proven by real-world results:

- **4 comprehensive case studies** analyzed (334+ PRs, 900+ commits)
- **Sustained velocity**: 3-11 PRs/day over weeks, not days
- **Quality outcomes**: 1-3 commits for 80% of well-prompted work
- **Production results**: From idea to production in 2-5 weeks

## What You'll Learn

This site provides:

- **Specific prompts** that get results (Problem-Context-Solution structure)
- **Proven patterns** extracted from successful projects
- **Anti-patterns** to avoid (learned from struggles)
- **Measurable practices** you can track and improve

## Evidence-Based Approach

All recommendations come from systematic analysis of real repositories:

- **[dikuclient](https://github.com/anicolao/dikuclient)**: 63 PRs in 18 days—shows foundation-to-feature progression
- **[DikuMUD](https://github.com/anicolao/DikuMUD)**: 165 PRs in 15 days—demonstrates design-first at scale
- **[morpheum](https://github.com/anicolao/morpheum)**: 76 PRs in 37 days—illustrates interface-first architecture
- **[diku](https://github.com/anicolao/diku)**: 30 issues in 5 days—exemplifies issue-driven development
