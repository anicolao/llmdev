# LLM Development

**Proven practices for building software with AI assistance**

This site distills insights from analyzing real-world projects built with GitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants. Learn what actually worksâ€”backed by evidence from production codebases.

## Evidence-Based Insights

Every practice on this site is backed by analysis of real repositories:

- **4 comprehensive case studies** (180+ PRs, 900+ commits analyzed)
- **Proven velocity patterns**: 3-11 PRs/day sustained for weeks
- **Measurable outcomes**: 1-3 commits for 80% of well-scoped work
- **Production results**: From prototype to production in weeks

## What Makes This Different

Most AI coding advice is speculation. This site is built on **systematic analysis** of what actually works in production:

âœ… Specific examples from real PRs  
âœ… Metrics that matter (velocity, iteration, quality)  
âœ… Anti-patterns to avoid  
âœ… Actionable templates you can use today  

## About This Site

This site was built using its own methodology:

1. **Clear Vision**: Started with VISION.md defining the mission and goals
2. **Design Analysis**: Evaluated multiple approaches before implementation  
3. **Tiny MVP**: Built a minimal working kernel (phased instruction approach)
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Enhanced through real-world use and feedback

The content comes from the [llmdev project](https://github.com/anicolao/llmdev)â€”tools for analyzing LLM-assisted development patterns.
