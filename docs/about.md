# About LLM Development

## The Project

LLM Development is a site dedicated to sharing evidence-based practices for building software with AI assistance. All recommendations are backed by systematic analysis of real-world projects.

### Evidence Sources

Our insights come from analyzing production repositories:

- **[dikuclient](https://github.com/anicolao/dikuclient)**: 63 PRs over 18 days, 3.5 PRs/day sustained velocity
- **[DikuMUD](https://github.com/anicolao/DikuMUD)**: 165 PRs over 15 days, 11 PRs/day sustained velocity
- **[morpheum](https://github.com/anicolao/morpheum)**: 76 PRs over 37 days, interface-first architecture
- **[diku](https://github.com/anicolao/diku)**: 30 issues in 5 days, 6 issues/day velocity

These projects represent:
- 334+ pull requests analyzed
- 900+ commits studied
- 4 comprehensive case studies
- Weeks of sustained high-velocity development

### Analysis Methodology

Each case study follows a rigorous phased approach:

1. **Repository Overview**: Gather statistics, timeline, key metrics
2. **LLM Usage Detection**: Identify Copilot mentions, patterns, explicit attribution
3. **Development Story Arc**: Extract phases, milestones, evolution
4. **Prompt Analysis**: Study what prompts worked, identify patterns
5. **Iteration Patterns**: Analyze commit counts, complexity, refinement cycles
6. **Development Patterns**: Extract practices, anti-patterns, success factors
7. **Best Practices**: Synthesize actionable recommendations
8. **Technical Insights**: Document technology-specific learnings

### What Makes This Different

Most AI coding advice is:
- Based on speculation or limited examples
- Marketing material from vendors
- Anecdotes without metrics
- Theory without practical validation

LLM Development is:
- Evidence-based: Every claim backed by specific PRs
- Metric-driven: Velocity, iteration counts, success rates
- Production-tested: Real projects, real outcomes
- Actionable: Templates, checklists, concrete examples

## About the llmdev Tool

The [llmdev project](https://github.com/anicolao/llmdev) provides tools for analyzing LLM-assisted development:

**Key Features:**
- Phased instruction generation for comprehensive repository analysis
- MCP tool integration (works with GitHub Copilot)
- Systematic case study creation methodology
- No API rate limit issues

**Use Cases:**
- Creating case studies of LLM-assisted projects
- Analyzing development patterns in repositories
- Studying prompt effectiveness
- Understanding iteration strategies

## How This Site Was Built

This site was created using its own methodology—a practical demonstration of the practices we teach.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Getting Started)

**Clear README**
- The llmdev project started with comprehensive README.md
- Documented installation, usage, and examples
- Provided clear context for AI assistance

**Compelling VISION**
- Created VISION.md defining mission and principles
- Established success criteria
- Identified open questions and long-term goals

**Tiny MVP**
- Built minimal instruction generator (Phase 1)
- Got it working and tested in hours
- Iterated from that kernel

### Phase 2: Organization (Staying Organized)

**Design Analysis**
- Evaluated multiple approaches:
  1. Direct API analysis (tried first, hit rate limits)
  2. Phased instruction generation (chosen approach)
  3. Hybrid caching system (considered but deferred)

**Alternative Selection**
- Chose phased instructions based on evidence:
  - Pro: No rate limits
  - Pro: Works on any repository size
  - Pro: Proven with real case studies
  - Con: Requires MCP tools (acceptable trade-off)

**Design Documents**
- Created DESIGN_OPTIONS.md for architectural decisions
- Documented MVP.md with approach and rationale
- Planned MVP2.md for future enhancements

### Phase 3: Iteration (Leveling Up)

**Rapid Iteration**
- Created case studies through phased analysis
- Refined instruction templates based on usage
- Improved guidance incrementally

**Specific Prompts**
- Problem-Context-Solution structure for features
- Clear constraints in prompts
- Success criteria for each phase

**Test-First Development**
- 51 tests covering core functionality
- Tests guided development
- 62% code coverage maintained

### Phase 4: Consolidation (Sharpen the Saw)

**Periodic Consolidation**
- Consolidated learnings into SUMMARY.md
- Created this documentation site (consolidation of insights)
- Captured patterns in copilot-instructions.md

**Documentation Updates**
- Kept README current with approach evolution
- Updated QUICKSTART.md based on user feedback
- Created comprehensive case studies

**Reflection**
- Learned that direct API approach failed (documented in MVP.md)
- Identified successful phased approach through iteration
- Captured best practices from case study creation

## Timeline: Building This Site

**Foundation Phase** (Original llmdev development):
- Day 1-2: README + VISION + basic structure
- Day 3-7: MVP instruction generator
- Week 2-4: First case studies created

**Enhancement Phase**:
- Analyzed 4 comprehensive repositories
- Distilled insights into SUMMARY.md
- Created reusable patterns and templates

**Documentation Phase** (This site):
- Day 1: Planned site structure and content
- Day 2: Created How To guides from case study insights
- Day 3: Set up GitHub Pages with Jekyll
- Day 4: Polish and publish

**Total**: Weeks of analysis → Hours of site creation (because foundation was solid)

## Success Metrics

The llmdev project demonstrates the practices it teaches:

**Velocity:**
- Sustained development over weeks
- Multiple comprehensive case studies completed
- Rapid iteration on instruction templates

**Quality:**
- 51 tests passing
- Clear documentation
- Actionable outputs (case studies)

**Learning:**
- Failed approaches documented (MVP.md)
- Successful patterns captured (SUMMARY.md)
- Continuous improvement (MVP2.md planning)
