# LLM Dev

A toolkit for analyzing and understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GitHub Copilot are used to build real-world systems.

## Overview

The `llmdev` project provides tools to inspect GitHub repositories and identify code written with the assistance of LLMs, particularly GitHub Copilot. By analyzing these codebases, we can:

- Understand what patterns and practices work well when using LLMs for development
- Identify common pitfalls and challenges in LLM-assisted coding
- Distill learnings from successful and unsuccessful attempts
- Build a knowledge base of best practices for LLM-augmented development

## Purpose

As LLMs become increasingly integrated into software development workflows, it's crucial to understand their impact on code quality, development velocity, and long-term maintainability. This project aims to:

1. **Analyze LLM-generated code**: Develop tools to identify and extract code written or modified by LLMs in GitHub repositories
2. **Evaluate outcomes**: Assess the quality, maintainability, and effectiveness of LLM-assisted development
3. **Extract insights**: Summarize patterns of success and failure to guide future development practices
4. **Share knowledge**: Create a repository of findings that can help developers and teams use LLMs more effectively

## Goals

- Build tools to detect LLM-generated code in repositories
- Create metrics and analysis frameworks for evaluating LLM-assisted development
- Document case studies of successful and unsuccessful LLM usage
- Develop best practices and guidelines for effective LLM-augmented development

## Getting Started

This project is currently in early development. Check the [VISION.md](VISION.md) document for more details about the long-term goals and philosophy of the project.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! As we develop the tools and methodologies, we'll be looking for:

- Ideas for detection and analysis approaches
- Case studies from real projects
- Feedback on the tools and frameworks we develop
