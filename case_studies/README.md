# Case Studies Directory

This directory contains detailed case studies of repositories analyzed using the llmdev tooling. Each case study examines how LLMs (particularly GitHub Copilot) are used in real-world software development projects.

## Purpose

These case studies aim to:

1. **Document Patterns**: Identify successful and unsuccessful patterns in LLM-assisted development
2. **Share Learnings**: Extract insights that can benefit the broader developer community
3. **Guide Best Practices**: Develop recommendations based on real-world observations
4. **Build Knowledge Base**: Create a growing repository of LLM development insights

## Case Study Format

Each case study follows a consistent structure:

- **Repository Overview**: Basic metadata and statistics
- **Executive Summary**: Key findings at a glance
- **Development Patterns**: Observed practices and approaches
- **What Went Well**: Successes and positive outcomes
- **What Could Be Improved**: Areas for enhancement
- **Best Practices**: Actionable recommendations with examples
- **Recommendations**: Guidance for different audiences (developers, maintainers, organizations)
- **Technical Insights**: Technology-specific observations
- **Methodology**: How the analysis was performed

## Available Case Studies

### [GITHUB_ANICOLAO_DIKUCLIENT.md](./GITHUB_ANICOLAO_DIKUCLIENT.md)

**Repository:** [anicolao/dikuclient](https://github.com/anicolao/dikuclient)  
**Focus:** Modern Go TUI MUD client  
**LLM Tool:** GitHub Copilot (copilot-swe-agent)  
**Analysis Date:** October 22, 2025

**Key Findings:**
- 77.5% of development activity involves explicit Copilot usage
- Demonstrates excellent patterns for transparent LLM-assisted development
- Shows effective iterative refinement process
- Highlights importance of human oversight

**Best For Learning About:**
- Transparent LLM usage through naming conventions
- Bot-driven commits with human review
- Iterative development with feedback loops
- Rapid feature development with AI assistance

## How to Use These Case Studies

### For Developers

- Study the patterns that work well
- Learn from the challenges identified
- Apply best practices to your own projects
- Understand effective prompting and iteration strategies

### For Teams

- Use as reference for establishing LLM usage guidelines
- Share insights during retrospectives
- Develop team standards based on observed patterns
- Train team members on effective LLM collaboration

### For Researchers

- Analyze trends across multiple case studies
- Validate hypotheses about LLM effectiveness
- Identify areas for tool improvement
- Contribute to the body of knowledge on AI-assisted development

## Contributing Case Studies

We welcome contributions of new case studies! To contribute:

1. Use the llmdev tool to analyze a repository
2. Follow the established case study format
3. Include both quantitative data and qualitative observations
4. Provide actionable recommendations
5. Document your methodology
6. Submit a pull request

### Naming Convention

Case study files should be named:
```
GITHUB_OWNER_REPO.md
```

For example:
- `GITHUB_MICROSOFT_VSCODE.md`
- `GITHUB_FACEBOOK_REACT.md`
- `GITHUB_ANICOLAO_DIKUCLIENT.md`

## Analysis Methodology

All case studies are created using the llmdev analysis tool, which:

1. Fetches repository data via GitHub API
2. Analyzes commits, pull requests, and issues
3. Detects LLM usage patterns (explicit mentions, bot authors)
4. Generates statistical summaries
5. Provides raw data for manual analysis and insights

For details, see the Methodology section in each case study.

## Future Directions

As this collection grows, we plan to:

- Compare patterns across different languages and domains
- Track evolution of LLM usage over time
- Identify common challenges and solutions
- Develop more sophisticated detection methods
- Create visualization tools for insights

## License

These case studies are released under the same CC0 license as the llmdev project, making them freely available for anyone to use, share, and build upon.
