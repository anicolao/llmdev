## Development Story Arc

### Phase 0: Prehistory - Gemini CLI Bootstrapping (Aug 9-19, 2025)

**Context:** Before the PR-based development captured in this case study began, morpheum was bootstrapped using Google's Gemini CLI tool. This "prehistory" phase (August 9-19) laid the foundation for the repository but is not documented in GitHub PRs—only in tasks and devlogs.

**Evidence Sources:**
- 81 tasks migrated from legacy `TASKS.md`
- 108 devlog entries migrated from legacy `DEVLOG.md`
- Tasks #1-5: Initial setup, Matrix bot, Gemini CLI integration
- Devlogs document friction points, tool transitions, architecture decisions

#### Bootstrap Process (Tasks #1-5)

**Task #1: Initial Project Setup**
- Created `src/morpheum-bot/` directory
- Installed Matrix bot SDK and TypeScript
- Set up `tsconfig.json`

**Task #2: Basic Bot Implementation**
- Implemented `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts`
- Connected to Matrix homeserver
- Implemented `!help` command

**Task #3: Gemini CLI Integration (Proof of Concept)**
- Forked Gemini CLI repository
- Investigated TypeScript → Gemini CLI invocation
- Implemented `!gemini <prompt>` command

**Task #4: GitHub Integration in Gemini CLI**
- Added `gh` tool to forked Gemini CLI
- Tested `gh` commands through bot
- Documented invocation patterns

**Task #5: DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md Management**
- Bot read/write to DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md
- Commands to add devlog entries and update task status

#### The Gemini CLI Crisis (Aug 11-12)

**Devlog 2025-08-11: "Refactor the gemini-cli into a library"**
- Refactored Gemini CLI core into `library.ts`
- Created non-React `ToolScheduler` for shell/file operations
- Integrated library into morpheum-bot (replacing `exec` calls)
- **Friction:** "Repeatedly struggled with the `replace` tool"
- **Success:** "Library-first approach superior to shelling out to CLI"

**Devlog 2025-08-12: "Switching from Gemini CLI to claudecode"**
- **Critical Decision:** Abandoned Gemini CLI mid-project
- **Reasons for abandoning:**
  - Token limit exhaustion (6M tokens/hour due to `replace` tool failures)
  - Procedural failures (not following DEVLOG.md, AGENTS.md conventions)
  - Unexplained pauses mid-task
  - Usage limits (60-90 min/day effective limit)
  - No upstream support (GitHub issue #5983 ignored)

**Quote from devlog:** _"While the original goal was to use a tool like Gemini CLI to bootstrap its own replacement, the current state of the tool makes this untenable."_

#### The Jail Architecture Pivot (Aug 17-18)

**Devlog 2025-08-17: "Implement and Debug Jailed Agent Environment"**
- Built isolated container environment for agent execution
- **Failed Approach #1:** Custom Docker image via `nix build` on macOS (Linux dependencies incompatible)
- **Failed Approach #2:** `nix build` inside container (nested virtualization + KVM unavailable)
- **Successful Approach #3:** Standard `nixos/nix` image with runtime tool installation

**Technical Breakthroughs:**
- Networking debugging (Colima `--network-address` flag)
- Docker context configuration (`DOCKER_HOST` in `shellHook`)
- Shell interaction (non-interactive `bash -l` for clean I/O)

**Devlog 2025-08-18: "Stabilize Jail Communication"**
- Extensive debugging of shell environment inside Docker
- **Key Discovery:** `socat`'s `SYSTEM:"bash -li 2>&1"` enables stderr redirection
- Implemented readiness probe (polling with `echo` command)
- **Success:** "Robust, stable, and correctly captures stderr"

**Devlog 2025-08-18: "Remove gemini-cli Submodule"**
- Confirmed no remaining code dependencies
- Removed submodule from repository
- **Pattern:** Clean break after architectural pivot

#### Prehistory Patterns Identified

**What Went Well:**
1. **Rapid bootstrapping** - Matrix bot operational within days
2. **Library-first refactoring** - Successfully extracted Gemini CLI core
3. **Test-driven approach** - Unit/integration tests caught bugs early
4. **Iterative debugging** - Three jail architecture attempts led to robust solution
5. **Documentation discipline** - DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md from inception

**Challenges & Anti-Patterns:**
1. **Tool dependency risk** - Betting on unstable tool (Gemini CLI) created crisis
2. **Token consumption bugs** - `replace` tool failures caused 6M token/hour usage
3. **Procedural non-compliance** - Gemini CLI ignored project conventions
4. **Platform compatibility** - macOS → Linux Docker issues with Nix builds
5. **Nested virtualization** - Container-in-container KVM requirements failed

**Critical Learnings:**
1. **"Don't depend on broken tools"** - Switch quickly when tool becomes blocker
2. **"Runtime > Build-time"** - Installing packages at runtime more portable than custom images
3. **"Non-interactive shells for automation"** - Clean I/O without terminal echo
4. **"Readiness probes essential"** - Services with slow startup need validation
5. **"Environment automation crucial"** - `shellHook` auto-configuration improves DX

**Transition to PR-Based Development:**
- Gemini CLI abandoned by August 12
- Jail architecture stabilized by August 18
- Transitioned to Claude Code / GitHub Copilot workflow
- First PR (#1) created August 20 - repository now production-ready for collaborative AI development

**Prehistory Significance:**
The August 9-19 period established:
- Matrix bot foundation
- Jail sandboxing architecture
- DEVLOG/TASKS workflow (later migrated to directory structure in PR #47)
- Hard lessons about tool selection and architecture robustness

This prehistory demonstrates that **even the bootstrapping of an AI development tool faced significant AI tooling failures**, but systematic debugging and willingness to pivot led to a solid foundation for the subsequent PR-based development phases.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Integration (PRs #1-3, Aug 20 01:36-03:00)

The day began with essential housekeeping and core feature integration.

#### PR #1: Documentation Cleanup (01:36-02:44, 1h 8m)
**Problem Context:** Project had evolved from conceptual phase to working implementation, but documentation was outdated.

**Changes Made:**
- Deprecated obsolete design documents (Gemini CLI, jail prototype)
- Updated package manager references (bun/npm)
- Aligned README with current v0.2 project state
- Maintained historical context rather than deleting files

**Why This Matters:** Shows disciplined approach to technical debt—addressing documentation drift before it becomes problematic. The decision to deprecate rather than delete preserved development history.

#### PR #2: OpenAI API Integration (01:41-02:57, 1h 16m)
**Major Feature:** Comprehensive OpenAI API support with dual-provider architecture.

**Key Innovations:**
- `LLMClient` interface abstraction (enables provider switching)
- Factory pattern for client instantiation (`createLLMClient()`)
- Support for OpenAI-compatible APIs via custom base URLs
- New bot commands: `!llm switch`, `!openai`, `!ollama`, `!llm status`
- 26+ new tests for OpenAI functionality

**Architecture Quality:**
```typescript
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
  // Clean abstraction allows easy provider addition
}
```

**Why This Succeeded:** Clear separation of concerns. The interface abstraction made it trivial to add providers later (streaming in PR #7).

#### PR #3: Apply Review Feedback (02:24-03:00, 36m)
**Refinement:** Quick iteration addressing PR #1 and #2 review comments.

**Changes:**
- Enhanced bot status messages to show model info: `"Working on: [task] using [model]..."`
- Improved test script compatibility (`npx vitest` instead of `vitest`)
- Updated documentation (DEVLOG.md, TASKS.md)

**Pattern:** Immediate response to feedback. Only 24 minutes after PR #2 merged, addressing its feedback. This rapid iteration prevented technical debt accumulation.

### Phase 2: Stabilization & Quality (PRs #4-6, Aug 20 03:01-05:10)

With core features in place, focus shifted to ensuring quality and correctness.

#### PR #4: Fix All Failing Tests (03:01-03:52, 51m)
**Challenge:** Tests were failing due to mock/expectation mismatches.

**Solutions:**
- Fixed markdown formatting mocks (markdown-it behavior vs expectations)
- Added global fetch mocking for network calls
- Updated file operation tests to use real file content
- Result: All 46 tests passing

**Lesson:** Tests must match actual behavior, not idealized expectations. The shift from mocking to real file content testing improved integration validation.

#### PR #5: Fix bot.test.ts Mocks (03:55-04:14, 19m)
**Surgical Fix:** Two remaining test failures in file commands.

**Root Cause:** Generic mocks returning same content for all files.

**Solution:** File-specific mock returns:
```typescript
// Enhanced mock
TASKS.md → "# Tasks\n..."
DEVLOG.md → "# DEVLOG\n..."
```

**Speed:** Only 19 minutes—demonstrates value of targeted fixes over wholesale rewrites.

#### PR #6: Fix Gauntlet Validation (04:23-05:10, 47m)
**Critical Fix:** Validation was checking file content, not actual server functionality.

**Before:**
```typescript
const { stdout } = await execa(..., "cat server.js");
return stdout.includes("Hello, Morpheum!");
```

**After:**
```typescript
const serverProcess = execa(..., "bun run server.js");
await sleep(3000);
const { stdout } = await execa(..., "curl localhost:3000");
serverProcess.kill();
return stdout.includes("Hello, Morpheum!");
```

**Impact:** Eliminated false positives. Agents must now create working servers, not just files with correct text.

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Future Planning (PRs #7-10, Aug 20 11:08-18:52)

With a stable foundation, development pivoted to user experience and extensibility.

#### PR #7: Streaming Support (11:08-12:26, 1h 18m)
**Major Enhancement:** Real-time feedback during LLM operations.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extended `LLMClient` with `sendStreaming(prompt, callback)`
- OpenAI: Server-Sent Events (SSE) parsing
- Ollama: JSONL (newline-delimited JSON) parsing
- Backward compatible (kept existing `send()` method)

**UX Impact:**
```
Before: [long silence] → complete response
After:  🤖 → 🧠 → ⚡ → [streaming text] → ✅
```

**Test Coverage:** 50/50 tests passing (grew from 46)

#### PR #8: Enhanced Bot Feedback (12:28-18:02, 5h 34m)
**Longest PR:** Significant UX overhaul with multiple improvements.

**Features Added:**
1. **Markdown spoilers** for large output (collapsible code blocks)
2. **Early termination** detection ("Job's done!" phrase)
3. **Plan/Next Step visibility** (extracted from `<plan>` and `<next_step>` tags)
4. **Smart output handling**: Small outputs inline, large outputs in spoilers

**Example Output:**
```
📋 Plan: [bot's strategy displayed]
🎯 Next step: [current action shown]
[command output with spoilers for long content]
```

**Why This Took Longest:** Multiple interconnected features requiring careful integration and testing.

#### PR #9: Clean Jail Output (16:00-16:44, 44m)
**Surgical Fix:** Bash warnings polluting command output.

**Problem:** `bash -li` (interactive mode) complained about missing terminal.

**Solution:** Changed to `bash -l` (non-interactive with login environment).

**Result:**
```
Before: bash: no job control warnings\nrunner@container:~/$ echo...
After:  Hello World\nCOMMAND_ENDED_EOC
```

**Impact:** Clean, professional output for users. Only 2 characters changed (`-li` → `-l`).

#### PR #10: Copilot Integration Design (18:02-18:52, 50m)
**Strategic Planning:** Comprehensive design proposal for GitHub Copilot integration.

**Proposed Architecture:**
- `CopilotClient` class implementing `LLMClient` interface
- Issue creation → Copilot session → PR generation workflow
- Real-time status streaming to Matrix chat
- Commands: `!copilot status`, `!copilot list`, `!copilot cancel`

**Why This Matters:** Shows forward-thinking design. The `LLMClient` abstraction from PR #2 makes this integration straightforward—a validation of the initial architecture.

### Phase 4: GitHub Integration & Ecosystem (PRs #11-65, Aug 21, 2025)

The day after the foundation sprint, development shifted to integrating Morpheum into the GitHub ecosystem and building essential infrastructure. This 6-hour intensive period produced 20+ PRs focused on GitHub Copilot provider implementation, documentation sites, and production robustness.

- Helpful guidance suggesting correct command
- Better validation with clear error messages
- Comprehensive tests for all URL formats

**Pattern:** User feedback → immediate fix with helpful error messages that teach correct usage.

#### PR #156: Jekyll Build Fixes (Sept 15, 05:57)
**User Prompt:** GitHub Pages deployment failures blocking documentation.

**Three Issues Fixed:**
1. **YAML frontmatter syntax errors** - Unescaped quotes in devlog files
2. **Missing Jekyll layouts** - Created `task.html` and `devlog.html` layouts
3. **Invalid include paths** - Copied `ONBOARDING.md` to `docs/_includes/`

**Pattern:** Infrastructure hygiene—fix deployment blockers to maintain documentation flow.

#### PR #158: Repository Creation Command Fix (Sept 15, 13:29)
**User Prompt:** "The !project create —new is still not working; I tried `!project create —new tabletop-image` and `!project create —new anicolao/nixtabletop`"

**Root Cause:** Missing Unicode dash normalization in `handleProjectCreate()` method—inconsistent with other command handlers.

**Solution:**
- Added `normalizeArgsArray()` to project create handler
- Recognizes `—new` (em dash) as equivalent to `--new` (double dash)
- All 353 tests continue to pass
- New comprehensive test suite prevents regression

**Pattern:** Iteration on user feedback—second attempt after PR #155 addressed different aspect of same UX issue. Both em-dash and argument validation needed fixing.

**Phase Summary:**
- **6 PRs in ~12 hours** (Sept 15, 01:34-13:29)
- **Issue management infrastructure**: Design → Implementation of task dashboard and search
- **User feedback iterations**: Two PRs fixing repository creation based on actual user attempts
- **Infrastructure maintenance**: Jekyll build fixes for deployment
- **User prompts driving work**: Direct user reports of command failures led to UX improvements
- **Prompt patterns**: Feature requests, bug reports with examples, infrastructure failures
- **Quality focus**: Comprehensive tests (336 → 353), helpful error messages, phased implementation

### Phase 6: Infrastructure & Feature Development (PRs #106-121, Aug 26 - Sept 15)

The late August through mid-September period saw both infrastructure improvements and a major new feature: project-specific Matrix rooms.

#### Early August: Quality & Infrastructure (PRs #106, #108)

**PR #106: Gauntlet Task Ordering** (Aug 26, 02:20)
**Problem:** Tasks weren't ordered by difficulty—complex Nix package management before simple directory creation.

**Solution:** Reordered to: create-project-dir (simplest) → check-sed-available → add-jq (complex Nix).

**Pattern:** Quality focus—proper difficulty progression for AI evaluation tool. Added 4 tests to maintain ordering.

**PR #108: Gauntlet Provider Validation** (Aug 26, 02:00)
**Bug:** Checked bot's current provider instead of requested provider, blocking valid `--provider openai` when bot was in copilot mode.

**Fix:** Removed incorrect early validation; existing arg parsing already validates provider choice.

**Pattern:** Minimal surgical fix—changed only the problematic validation, preserving all security.

#### Late August - Early September: Matrix Infrastructure (PRs #109, #110, #112)

**PR #109: Matrix Delegation** (Sept 6, 11:17)
**Purpose:** Enable clean `@username:morpheum.dev` addresses while homeserver runs on `matrix.morpheum.dev`.

**Implementation:**
- Added `.well-known/matrix/client` with homeserver delegation
- Updated Jekyll config to serve dot-files
- Fixed malformed JSON in MATRIX_SETUP.md
- Follows Matrix spec (MSC1929)

**Pattern:** Standards compliance—proper delegation enables architectural flexibility.

**PR #110: Registration Command** (Sept 7, 00:35)
**Feature:** `--register` flag for automated bot registration on Matrix homeservers requiring tokens.

**Implementation:**
```bash
export REGISTRATION_TOKEN_MATRIX_MORPHEUM_DEV=token
bun src/morpheum-bot/index.ts --register matrix.morpheum.dev
```

**Details:**
- Environment variable generation from server URLs
- Unicode dash normalization (reusing existing patterns)
- Matrix JS SDK integration
- 233 tests passing

**Pattern:** Infrastructure automation—removing manual setup barriers.

#### Major Feature: Project Rooms (PRs #112, #114, #116)

**PR #112: Design Document** (Sept 7, 01:44)
**Vision:** Dedicated Matrix rooms per GitHub project with automatic Copilot integration.

**Specification:**
- Command: `!project create git@github.com:user/repo`
- Supports SSH, HTTPS, short format URLs
- Matrix room creation with auto-invite
- Room-specific configuration (repository, LLM provider)
- Rate limit: 100 rooms per user
- Storage: Matrix Room State Events (no local DB)

**Pattern:** Design-first development—comprehensive spec before implementation.

**PR #114: Implementation (Phase I)** (Sept 7, 09:53)
**Completed:**
- Git URL parser with multi-format support
- ProjectRoomManager for Matrix room management
- Bot commands: `!project create`, `!project help`
- Room-specific configuration with proper fallback
- Enhanced `!llm status` showing room context
- 255 tests passing

**Key Achievement:** Bot now applies project-specific settings (repo, LLM) when in project rooms while maintaining global config for regular rooms.

**Pattern:** Phased implementation—core functionality first, advanced features later.

**PR #116: Workflow Design** (Sept 15, 01:27)
**Document:** WORKFLOW.md for human-bot collaboration patterns.

**Covered:**
- Matrix rooms as project organizing containers
- Bot ownership and funding model
- Multiple roles per bot (reviewer, coder, etc.)
- Discovery patterns (`!bots`, `!help [role]`)
- Bot-to-bot coordination
- Project manager delegation (no broadcast spam)

**Pattern:** User experience design—document interaction patterns before enforcement.

#### Late September: Documentation Polish (PRs #117, #119, #121)

**PR #117: Quality Tooling** (Sept 13, closed as draft)
**Created:** `check.sh` and `find-check-hash.sh` for regression analysis.

**Findings:** 93 TypeScript errors documented, first failing commit identified.

**Pattern:** Observability—tools to understand when quality degraded.

**PR #119: Onboarding Guide** (Sept 15, closed as draft, superseded by #121)
**Content:** Comprehensive developer onboarding with Matrix setup, troubleshooting, development environment.

**PR #121: Onboarding Fixes** (Sept 15, 02:09)
**Improvements:**
- Fixed bash command errors (`cp` → `cat`)
- Added Matrix bot account creation steps
- Explained GitHub token requirements
- Fixed direnv workflow instructions
- Changed `bun install` to `npm install` for compatibility
- Added bot testing step
- 14-item review checklist completed

**Pattern:** Documentation iteration—review feedback improving onboarding experience.

#### Documentation & Process (PRs #86, #94)

**PR #86: ROADMAP.md Accuracy** (Aug 23, 16:46)
**Purpose:** Bring roadmap into alignment with actual project state.

**Changes:**
- Marked v0.1.2, v0.1.3, v0.2.2 as Done (were incorrectly shown as In Progress)
- Created 5 new task files for remaining v0.2 work (tasks 101-105)
- Fixed license compliance (Claude → Gemini reference)
- 188 tests passing

**Pattern:** Regular retrospection—ensure documentation matches reality.

**PR #94: Pre-commit Hook Enforcement** (Aug 23, 19:26)
**Problem:** Commits were bypassing workflow requirements (devlog + task entries).

**Solution:**
- Fixed Husky v9 configuration (`core.hooksPath`)
- Enhanced logic to require BOTH devlog AND task entries
- Smart file detection (documentation-only commits exempted)
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance

**Pattern:** Process automation—prevent mistakes before they enter version control.

#### User Experience (PRs #88, #90, #92, #96)

**PR #90: Website Transformation** (Aug 23, 18:07)
**Change:** Dark tech aesthetic → Scholarly academic style.

**Redesign:**
- Color palette: Bright lime green → Muted professional green
- Typography: Orbitron + Inter → Crimson Text + Inter
- Eliminated gradient fills, glows, excessive animations
- Narrowed layout from 1200px to 900px for optimal reading

**Pattern:** User-centric design—prioritize readability over flash.

**PR #88, #92, #96: Copilot Progress Tracking** (Aug 23, 17:48 - 19:41)
**Problem:** Long silent gaps during Copilot sessions—users couldn't follow progress.

**Evolution:**
- PR #88: Initial iframe integration attempt
- PR #92: Embedded GitHub's native progress interface with progressive enhancement
- PR #96: Fixed rendering with __DUAL_MESSAGE__ protocol (text + HTML versions)

**Result:**
- HTML clients: Full iframe showing detailed GitHub progress
- Text clients: Clean markdown links
- Multiple deep links (issue, PR, session)

**Pattern:** Progressive enhancement—rich experience where supported, graceful fallback everywhere.

#### Gauntlet Robustness (PRs #98, #100, #102, #104)

**PR #98: Setup Phase Fix** (Aug 23, 20:29)
**Bug:** File creation during validation overwrote bot's work.

**Fix:** Moved file creation from validation to pre-task setup phase.

**Pattern:** Execution order correctness—setup before execution before validation.

**PR #100: Container Environment** (Aug 23, 21:03)
**Problem:** Missing /project directory and flake.nix.

**Solution:**
- `mkdir -p /project` before file operations
- Comprehensive flake.nix with all required tools
- Task now self-sufficient

**Pattern:** Complete environment setup—don't assume preconditions.

**PR #102: Package & Output Fixes** (Aug 23, 22:04)
**Bugs:**
1. `sed` → should be `gnused` in nixpkgs
2. JSON parsing failed due to flake.nix shellHook pollution

**Fixes:**
1. Corrected package name
2. Added `cleanStdoutForJSON` before `JSON.parse`
3. Added 2 new tests (194 total)

**Pattern:** Surgical precision—fix exactly what's broken, add tests to prevent regression.

**PR #104: Metrics Tracking** (Aug 24, 01:07)
**Feature:** Real-time LLM usage metrics during gauntlet execution.

**Implementation:**
- MetricsTracker class with token estimation (4 chars/token heuristic)
- Extended LLMClient interface (`getMetrics()`, `resetMetrics()`)
- Enhanced progress table format:
  ```
  | Task | Status | Requests | Input Tokens | Output Tokens |
  | TOTAL | 3/4 | 3 | 51 | 114 |
  ```
- 216 tests passing

**Pattern:** Observability—make costs and efficiency visible during development.

## Prompt Analysis

While individual PR prompts aren't directly visible in PR descriptions, we can infer the communication patterns from PR titles and descriptions:

### Pattern 1: Problem-Solution Structure
Most PRs follow clear problem-solution narrative:

**PR #1:**
- **Problem:** "Documentation inconsistencies accumulated as project evolved"
- **Context:** "From initial conceptual phase to current working implementation"
- **Solution:** "Deprecation notices + updates to match current state"

**PR #6:**
- **Problem:** "Gauntlet validation only checked file content"
- **Context:** "Didn't test if server actually worked"
- **Solution:** "Start server, make HTTP request, verify response"

### Pattern 2: Incremental Refinement
PRs show progression from broad to specific:

1. **PR #2:** "Implement OpenAI API integration" (broad feature)
2. **PR #3:** "Apply PR review comments" (refinement)
3. **PR #4:** "Fix all failing tests" (quality)
4. **PR #5:** "Fix failing tests in bot.test.ts" (surgical)

### Pattern 3: Clear Deliverable Definition
Each PR has explicit success criteria:

**PR #7:** 
- ✅ Extend `LLMClient` interface
- ✅ Implement SSE parsing (OpenAI)

- PR #8: "Builds on streaming from PR #7"

**Effective Prompt Characteristics Observed:**
1. **Clear problem statement** (what's wrong or missing)
2. **Specific deliverables** (what success looks like)
3. **Context links** (relationship to other PRs)
4. **Technical constraints** (backward compatibility, test coverage)
5. **Quality criteria** (all tests passing, clean output)

---

## Iteration Patterns

### Iteration Classification

**Quick Wins (< 30 minutes):**
- PR #5: Fix mocks (19 minutes) - Surgical fix, clear problem

**Standard Complexity (30-90 minutes):**
- PR #3: Review feedback (36 minutes) - Well-defined changes
- PR #4: Fix tests (51 minutes) - Multiple test files
- PR #6: Gauntlet validation (47 minutes) - Rewrite validation logic
- PR #9: Jail output (44 minutes) - Simple fix, thorough testing
- PR #10: Copilot design (50 minutes) - Documentation only

**Complex Features (1-2 hours):**
- PR #1: Documentation (1h 8m) - Multiple files, careful preservation
- PR #2: OpenAI integration (1h 16m) - New client, tests, commands
- PR #7: Streaming (1h 18m) - Two different protocols, interface extension

**Major Enhancements (5+ hours):**
- PR #8: Enhanced feedback (5h 34m) - Multiple interconnected features

### What Determines Iteration Speed?

**Fast (< 1 hour):**
- ✅ Clear, isolated problem
- ✅ Well-defined success criteria
- ✅ Minimal interdependencies
- ✅ Examples: PR #5 (mocks), PR #9 (bash flag)

**Standard (1-2 hours):**
- ✅ New feature with clear boundaries
- ✅ Established patterns to follow
- ✅ Examples: PR #2 (following interface pattern), PR #7 (extending existing interface)

**Slow (5+ hours):**
- ⚠️ Multiple interdependent features
- ⚠️ Requires integration of several components
- ⚠️ UX/DX considerations
- ⚠️ Example: PR #8 (spoilers + early termination + plan extraction + output handling)

### Key Insight: Architecture Enables Speed

**PR #7 (streaming) took only 1h 18m because:**
- Clean `LLMClient` interface from PR #2
- Clear extension point (`sendStreaming()` method)
- Existing test patterns to follow

**PR #10 (Copilot design) validates architecture:**
- Can add third provider without touching existing code
- Interface abstraction proven extensible

**Contrast with PR #8:** 
- Multiple new features without existing patterns
- Requires inventing new approaches (spoilers, plan extraction)
- Result: 5h 34m (4x longer than new provider!)

---

## Development Patterns

### Pattern 1: Interface-First Design

**Observation:** The `LLMClient` interface (PR #2) enabled rapid provider addition.

**Evidence:**
- PR #2: Created interface + OpenAI implementation
- PR #7: Added streaming to interface + both implementations (1h 18m)
- PR #10: Planned third provider using same interface

**Best Practice:**
```typescript
// Good: Abstract interface
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
  sendStreaming(prompt: string, callback: (chunk: string) => void): Promise<string>;
}

// Enables easy addition of providers
class OpenAIClient implements LLMClient { ... }
class OllamaClient implements LLMClient { ... }
class CopilotClient implements LLMClient { ... }
```

**Lesson:** Invest in abstractions early. The ~30 minutes spent designing the interface saved hours in subsequent PRs.

### Pattern 2: Test-Driven Stabilization

**Observation:** PRs #4-5 focused exclusively on test quality before adding new features.

**Sequence:**
1. PR #2: Add feature with tests
2. PR #4: Fix all 46 tests
3. PR #5: Fix remaining 2 tests  
4. PR #6: Improve validation
5. ✅ Only then: PR #7 adds new features

**Why This Worked:**
- Stable foundation before building more
- Prevented cascading test failures
- Each new feature (PR #7+) built on green tests

**Anti-Pattern to Avoid:**
```
❌ Add feature → tests fail → add another feature → more tests fail → debt accumulates
✅ Add feature → stabilize tests → add next feature
```

### Pattern 3: Immediate Feedback Integration

**Observation:** PR #3 addressed PR #1-2 feedback in 36 minutes.

**Timeline:**
- 02:57: PR #2 merged
- 03:00: PR #3 merged (started at 02:24)

**Pattern:** Start addressing feedback before previous PR merges. Enables rapid iteration.

**Benefit:** Prevents technical debt. Small course corrections cheaper than large refactors.

### Pattern 4: Surgical Fixes Over Rewrites

**Observation:** PR #9 changed only 2 characters (`-li` → `-l`) to fix bash warnings.

**Alternatives Considered (likely):**
- ❌ Rewrite jail client
- ❌ Add output filtering
- ✅ Change bash invocation flag

**Why Surgical Approach Won:**
- Minimal risk
- Fast to implement (44 minutes including tests)
- Addresses root cause
- No side effects

**Lesson:** Always seek the smallest change that solves the problem.

### Pattern 5: Progressive Enhancement

**Observation:** Features added incrementally with backward compatibility.

**Example - Streaming (PR #7):**
```typescript
// PR #2: Basic interface
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
}

// PR #7: Extended interface (backward compatible)
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
  sendStreaming(prompt: string, callback: (chunk: string) => void): Promise<string>;
}

// Old code still works!
await client.send("Hello"); // ✅

// New code gets benefits
await client.sendStreaming("Hello", chunk => console.log(chunk)); // ✅
```

**Why This Matters:** No breaking changes. Existing functionality continues working while new capabilities added.

### Pattern 6: Design Before Implementation

**Observation:** PR #10 created comprehensive design doc before coding.

**Document Contents:**
- Architecture diagrams
- API specifications
- Command reference
- Implementation phases
- Security considerations

**Benefit:** Validates approach before investment. The `LLMClient` abstraction's success in PR #7 gave confidence the Copilot integration would work.

**Lesson:** For complex features, design docs prevent false starts.

---

## What Went Well

### 1. Clean Architectural Abstractions

**Success:** The `LLMClient` interface enabled effortless provider addition.

**Evidence:**
- PR #2: OpenAI client (1h 16m)
- PR #7: Added streaming to both providers (1h 18m)
- PR #10: Planned third provider with confidence

**Why It Worked:**
- Single responsibility (LLM interaction)
- Minimal interface (send + sendStreaming)
- No provider-specific leakage

**Replicable Pattern:**
```typescript
// Define interface first
interface Provider {
  // Minimal required methods
  coreOperation(): Promise<Result>;
}

// Implement multiple providers
class Provider1 implements Provider { ... }
class Provider2 implements Provider { ... }

// Use factory for instantiation
function createProvider(type: string): Provider {
  switch(type) {
    case 'provider1': return new Provider1();
    case 'provider2': return new Provider2();
  }
}
```

### 2. Rapid Feedback Cycles

**Success:** PR #3 addressed feedback from PRs #1-2 in 36 minutes.

**Pattern:**
1. Submit PR #2
2. Start working on feedback (PR #3) immediately
3. Both merge within 3 minutes of each other

**Why It Worked:**
- Prevented technical debt accumulation
- Small course corrections vs large refactors
- Maintained momentum

**Replicable Approach:**
- Don't wait for PR approval to start refinements
- Address feedback as soon as identified
- Keep changes small and focused

### 3. Test Stabilization Before New Features

**Success:** PRs #4-6 stabilized all tests before PR #7 added new features.

**Sequence:**
1. PR #2: Add OpenAI (tests included)
2. PR #4: Fix all 46 tests ✅
3. PR #5: Fix last 2 tests ✅
4. PR #6: Improve validation ✅
5. PR #7: Add streaming (on stable base)

**Why It Worked:**
- Clean slate for new features
- Prevented test debt spiral
- New features built on green tests

**Replicable Strategy:**
- After major feature, stabilize immediately
- Fix all tests before adding more
- Don't accumulate test debt

### 4. Progressive Enhancement Pattern

**Success:** PR #7 added streaming without breaking existing code.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Before (PR #2)
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
}

// After (PR #7) - backward compatible
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
  sendStreaming(prompt: string, cb): Promise<string>;
}
```

**Why It Worked:**
- Zero breaking changes
- Old code continues working
- New code gets new benefits
- No migration required

**Replicable Pattern:**
- Extend interfaces, don't replace
- Add optional methods
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 5. Surgical Fixes

**Success:** PR #9 fixed bash warnings with 2-character change.

**Change:** `bash -li` → `bash -l`

**Why It Worked:**
- Identified root cause
- Minimal change
- Low risk
- Fast to implement (44 min)

**Replicable Approach:**
1. Understand root cause
2. Find minimal fix
3. Verify no side effects
4. Implement quickly

### 6. Comprehensive PR Descriptions

**Success:** Every PR had detailed description of problem, solution, and impact.

**Example (PR #6):**
```markdown
## Problem
[Clear statement of what's wrong]

## Solution
[Before/after code showing fix]

## Impact
[What this enables/prevents]
```

**Why It Worked:**
- Clear communication
- Reviewers understand context
- Future developers understand decisions
- Creates knowledge base

**Replicable Template:**
```markdown
## Problem
[What's wrong/missing]

## Context
[Why this matters]

## Solution
[What was changed]

## Before/After
[Code examples]

## Testing
[How verified]

## Impact
[Benefits/risks]
```

---

## Challenges & Learnings

### Challenge 1: Test Mock Complexity (PRs #4-5)

**Problem:** Initial mocks were too generic, causing test failures.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Too generic
fs.readFile.mockResolvedValue("# Test Content");
// Breaks when testing specific files

// Fixed: File-specific mocks
fs.readFile.mockImplementation((filename) => {
  if (filename.includes('TASKS.md')) return "# Tasks\n...";
  if (filename.includes('DEVLOG.md')) return "# DEVLOG\n...";
});
```

**Lesson:** Mocks should match real behavior, not idealized simplicity.

**Replicable Solution:**
- Test with real data when possible
- If mocking, be specific
- Consider fixture files over inline mocks

### Challenge 2: Interconnected Features Take Longest (PR #8)

**Problem:** PR #8 took 5h 34m—much longer than new provider (1h 18m).

**Why:**
- Multiple interdependent features:
  - Markdown spoilers
  - Early termination detection
  - Plan/next step extraction
  - Smart output handling
- No existing patterns to follow
- Required inventing new approaches

**Lesson:** Interconnected features harder than new instances of established patterns.

**Replicable Strategy:**
- Break complex features into separate PRs when possible
- Establish patterns in first implementation
- Subsequent uses will be faster

### Challenge 3: Validation Must Test Reality (PR #6)

**Problem:** Gauntlet validation checked file content, not server functionality.

**Before:**
```typescript
// Gives false positives
const { stdout } = await execa("cat server.js");
return stdout.includes("Hello, Morpheum!");
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Tests actual behavior
const server = execa("bun run server.js");
await sleep(3000);
const { stdout } = await execa("curl localhost:3000");
server.kill();
return stdout.includes("Hello, Morpheum!");
```

**Lesson:** Validate behavior, not artifacts.

**Replicable Principle:**
- Test the interface, not the implementation
- Integration tests over unit tests for validation
- Run the actual code, don't just check it exists

### Challenge 4: Output Cleanliness Matters (PR #9)

**Problem:** Bash warnings polluted command output, hurting UX.

**Example:**
```
bash: no job control in this shell
bash: cannot set terminal process group
runner@container:~/$ echo 'Hello'
Hello
```

**Root Cause:** Interactive bash (`bash -li`) needs terminal.

**Solution:** Non-interactive bash (`bash -l`) loads environment without terminal.

**Lesson:** User-facing output must be clean and professional.

**Replicable Checklist:**
- [ ] No debug warnings in prod
- [ ] Clean output format
- [ ] No extraneous prompts/markers
- [ ] Easy to parse/read

### Challenge 5: Architectural Decisions Pay Off Later (PR #2 → PR #7 → PR #10)

**Observation:** Time invested in `LLMClient` abstraction (PR #2) paid dividends.

**Timeline:**
- PR #2: Design interface (~30 min) + OpenAI impl (1h 16m)
- PR #7: Add streaming to interface + both providers (1h 18m)  
  - Would have taken 2-3h without abstraction
- PR #10: Plan third provider with confidence
  - Would require architectural refactor without abstraction

**Lesson:** Good abstractions have exponential ROI.

**Replicable Pattern:**
1. Identify variation points early
2. Design interface for extensibility
3. Implement first instance carefully
4. Subsequent instances are fast

### Challenge 6: Documentation Drift is Real (PR #1)

**Problem:** Project evolved faster than documentation.

**Symptoms:**
- Deprecated features still documented
- Current state not reflected
- Setup instructions outdated

**Solution:**
- Deprecation notices (preserve history)
- Systematic update of all docs
- Align with current phase (v0.2)

**Lesson:** Documentation is code—treat it with same discipline.

**Replicable Strategy:**
- Review docs with each major feature
- Deprecate, don't delete (preserve history)
- Link deprecated docs to current equivalents
- Update all references consistently

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Interface-First Architecture

**What:** Design abstract interfaces before implementation.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Define interface (invest 30 min)
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
}

// Step 2: Implement first provider
class OpenAIClient implements LLMClient { ... }

// Step 3: Add more providers easily
class OllamaClient implements LLMClient { ... }
```

**When to Use:**
- Multiple implementations expected
- Variation points identified early
- Testing requires mocking

**Benefits:**
- Easy provider addition
- Clean testing (mock interface)
- Enforces consistency

### 2. Stabilize Tests Immediately

**What:** After adding features, fix all tests before proceeding.

**Pattern:**
```
Feature → Tests → Fix Tests → Next Feature
        ↓                ↓
    (May fail)     (Must pass)
```

**Example from morpheum:**
- PR #2: Add OpenAI → tests fail
- PR #4-5: Fix all tests → green
- PR #7: Add streaming → builds on green

**Benefits:**
- Prevents test debt spiral
- Each feature starts clean
- Easier debugging (one var at a time)

### 3. Progressive Enhancement

**What:** Extend interfaces without breaking existing code.

**How:**
```typescript
// V1: Basic functionality
interface Client {
  send(data: string): Promise<Result>;
}

// V2: Add optional enhancement
interface Client {
  send(data: string): Promise<Result>;
  sendStreaming?(data: string, cb): Promise<Result>; // Optional!
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero breaking changes
- Old code works
- New code gets benefits
- No migration required

### 4. Rapid Feedback Integration

**What:** Address feedback immediately, don't wait.

**Pattern:**
1. Submit PR A
2. Start PR B (addresses A's feedback)
3. Both merge quickly

**Example from morpheum:**
- PR #2 submitted at 01:41
- PR #3 (addresses #2 feedback) started at 02:24
- PR #2 merged at 02:57
- PR #3 merged at 03:00

**Benefits:**
- Fast iteration
- Small corrections
- No tech debt accumulation

### 5. Surgical Fixes Over Rewrites

**What:** Seek minimal change that solves problem.

**Decision Tree:**
```
Problem identified
↓
Can we change 1-10 lines? → Yes → Do it
↓ No
Can we change 1 file? → Yes → Do it
↓ No
Can we isolate change? → Yes → Refactor then fix
↓ No
Refactor architecture → Then fix
```

**Example:**
- PR #9: `bash -li` → `bash -l` (2 chars)
- Fixed bash warnings
- 44 minutes total

**Benefits:**
- Low risk
- Fast implementation
- Easy to review
- Minimal side effects

### 6. Comprehensive PR Descriptions

**What:** Every PR should tell a complete story.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Problem
[What's wrong or missing]

## Context  
[Why this matters]

## Solution
[What was changed]

## Before/After
[Code examples showing change]

## Technical Details
[Implementation notes]

## Testing
[How verified]

## Impact
[Benefits and risks]
```

**Example from PR #7:**
- ✅ Problem: No real-time feedback
- ✅ Solution: Streaming support
- ✅ Technical: SSE for OpenAI, JSONL for Ollama
- ✅ Testing: 50/50 tests passing
- ✅ Impact: Better UX, backward compatible

**Benefits:**
- Clear communication
- Faster reviews
- Knowledge preservation
- Onboarding tool

### 7. Validate Behavior, Not Artifacts

**What:** Test what code does, not what it contains.

**Wrong:**
```typescript
// Checks file content
const code = await readFile("server.js");
assert(code.includes("Hello, World"));
```

**Right:**
```typescript
// Tests actual behavior
const server = spawn("bun run server.js");
await sleep(3000);
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000");
assert(await response.text()).includes("Hello, World");
server.kill();
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches real bugs
- Prevents false positives
- Tests integration
- Validates what users see

### 8. Design Docs for Complex Features

**What:** Write design before implementing complex features.

**When:**
- Multiple components affected
- Architectural decisions required
- Uncertain approach

**Example:** PR #10 (Copilot integration)
- Full design doc before code
- Architecture diagrams
- API specifications
- Implementation phases
- Security considerations

**Benefits:**
- Validates approach early
- Gets feedback before coding
- Creates reference for implementation
- Prevents false starts

## Key Takeaways

### For Developers Using AI Tools

**1. Invest in Abstractions Early**
- The `LLMClient` interface (PR #2) took ~30 minutes to design
- Enabled 1h 18m provider addition (PR #7) instead of 3-4h
- Third provider planned (PR #10) with confidence
- **ROI: 4-5x time savings on subsequent work**

**2. Stabilize Before Building**
- PRs #4-6 fixed all tests before PR #7 added features
- Prevented test debt spiral
- Each new feature built on green tests
- **Pattern: Feature → Stabilize → Next Feature**

**3. Small, Focused PRs Win**
- 10 PRs in one day, average 1-2 hours each
- Quick wins (PR #5: 19 min) between complex features
- Surgical fixes (PR #9: 2 characters) over rewrites
- **Benefit: Fast reviews, clear history, easy rollback**

**4. Progressive Enhancement Prevents Breakage**
- PR #7 added streaming without breaking PR #2's code
- Extended interface, didn't replace
- Zero migration required
- **Pattern: Add, don't replace**

**5. Validate Reality, Not Artifacts**
- PR #6: Test servers by running them, not checking code
- Integration tests over artifact inspection
- **Principle: Test behavior, not implementation**

### For AI-Assisted Development

**1. Interfaces Enable AI Success**
- Clear contracts (LLMClient) guide AI implementations
- Multiple similar tasks (OpenAI → Ollama) become patterns
- AI excels at "do same thing differently"
- **Strategy: Design interface, let AI implement variations**

**2. Rapid Iteration Compounds**
- PR #3 addressed feedback in 36 minutes
- Small corrections prevent large refactors
- Momentum maintained across 10 PRs in one day
- **Pattern: Immediate feedback → Fast fixes → Compound velocity**

**3. Tests as Communication**
- 50+ tests document expected behavior
- AI understands "tests must pass" clearly
- Regression prevention is automatic
- **Strategy: Write tests, let AI maintain them**

**4. Documentation Preservation Matters**
- PR #1: Deprecated, didn't delete
- Historical context preserved
- Evolution visible
- **Pattern: Deprecate with explanation, don't erase history**

### Architectural Lessons

**1. Multi-Provider Architecture Pattern**
```typescript
// Interface defines contract
interface Provider {
  operation(): Promise<Result>;
}

// Factory creates instances
function createProvider(type: string): Provider;

// Usage is provider-agnostic
const provider = createProvider(config.type);
await provider.operation();
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to add providers
- Easy to test (mock interface)
- Easy to switch (factory)

**2. Progressive Enhancement Pattern**
```typescript
// V1: Core functionality
interface Service {
  basic(): Promise<Result>;
}

// V2: Enhanced functionality (backward compatible)
interface Service {
  basic(): Promise<Result>;
  enhanced?(options): Promise<Result>; // Optional!
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No breaking changes
- Gradual adoption
- Old code works forever

**3. Test Stabilization Pattern**
```
Feature A → Tests → Fix All Tests → Feature B → Tests → Fix All Tests
```

**Benefits:**
- One variable at a time
- Clean foundation for each feature
- Prevents debt accumulation

### Metrics That Mattered

**Development Velocity:**
- 10 PRs in 17 hours (Aug 20, 01:36-18:52)

## Technical Insights

### Multi-LLM Architecture

**Interface Design:**
```typescript
interface LLMClient {
  send(prompt: string): Promise<string>;
  sendStreaming(prompt: string, callback: (chunk: string) => void): Promise<string>;
}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Minimal interface**: Only essential methods
2. **Async by nature**: All operations return Promises
3. **Callback-based streaming**: Enables real-time updates
4. **Provider-agnostic**: No OpenAI/Ollama specifics leak

**Implementation Differences:**

| Aspect | OpenAI | Ollama |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Streaming Format | SSE (`data: {...}\n\n`) | JSONL (`{...}\n`) |
| Completion Signal | `data: [DONE]` | `{"done": true}` |
| Auth | API key in header | No auth (local) |
| Base URL | `api.openai.com/v1` | `localhost:11434` |

**Why This Works:**
- Interface hides differences
- Each client handles its protocol
- Factory selects based on config

### Streaming Implementation Details

**OpenAI SSE Parser:**
```typescript
const reader = response.body?.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  
  const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
  const lines = chunk.split('\n');
  
  for (const line of lines) {
    if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
      if (line.includes('[DONE]')) return fullResponse;
      
      const json = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));
      const content = json.choices[0].delta.content;
      if (content) {
        callback(content);
        fullResponse += content;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Ollama JSONL Parser:**
```typescript
const reader = response.body?.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  
  const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
  const lines = chunk.split('\n').filter(l => l.trim());
  
  for (const line of lines) {
    const json = JSON.parse(line);
    if (json.done) return fullResponse;
    
    if (json.response) {
      callback(json.response);
      fullResponse += json.response;
    }
  }
}
```

**Lessons:**
- Different protocols, same interface
- Handle chunk boundaries carefully
- Accumulate full response while streaming

### Test Architecture

**Mocking Strategy:**
```typescript
// Good: Specific mocks
vi.mock('fs', () => ({
  promises: {
    readFile: vi.fn((filename) => {
      if (filename.includes('TASKS.md')) return "# Tasks\n...";
      if (filename.includes('DEVLOG.md')) return "# DEVLOG\n...";
      return "# Generic\n...";
    })
  }
}));

// Bad: Generic mocks
vi.mock('fs', () => ({
  promises: {
    readFile: vi.fn(() => "# Test\n...")  // Same for all files!
  }
}));
```

**Network Call Mocking:**
```typescript
// Global fetch mock for OpenAI/Ollama tests
global.fetch = vi.fn((url) => {
  if (url.includes('openai')) {
    return Promise.resolve({
      json: () => Promise.resolve({
        choices: [{ message: { content: 'Response' } }]
      })
    });
  }
  // ... handle other URLs
});
```

**Benefits:**
- No real API calls in tests
- Consistent test environment
- Fast test execution

### Jail/Sandbox Implementation

**Architecture:**
```
Host System
    ↓
Docker Container (jail)
    ↓
Bash Session (bash -l)
    ↓
Command Execution
```

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Non-interactive bash** (`-l` not `-li`): Avoids terminal warnings
2. **Login shell** (`-l`): Loads user environment
3. **Command delimiter** (`COMMAND_ENDED_EOC`): Marks output boundaries
4. **Process isolation**: Docker container per session

**Output Cleaning:**
```typescript
private cleanOutput(output: string): string {
  return output
    .split('COMMAND_ENDED_EOC')[0]  // Take before delimiter
    .replace(/runner@container:.*?\$/g, '')  // Remove prompts
    .trim();
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Clean output for users
- No bash warnings
- No extraneous prompts
- Professional appearance

### Bot Feedback Architecture

**Plan/Next Step Extraction:**
```typescript
function extractPlan(response: string): string | null {
  const match = response.match(/<plan>(.*?)<\/plan>/s);
  return match ? match[1].trim() : null;
}

function extractNextStep(response: string): string | null {
  const match = response.match(/<next_step>(.*?)<\/next_step>/s);
  return match ? match[1].trim() : null;
}
```

**Usage:**
```typescript
const plan = extractPlan(llmResponse);
if (plan && !displayedPlan) {
  await sendMarkdownMessage(`📋 **Plan:**\n${plan}`);
  displayedPlan = true;
}

const nextStep = extractNextStep(llmResponse);
if (nextStep) {
  await sendMarkdownMessage(`🎯 **Next step:**\n${nextStep}`);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Users see bot's thinking
- Transparent reasoning
- Better trust and understanding

**Smart Output Handling:**
```typescript
if (lines.length < 50 && output.length < 5000) {
  // Small output: display inline
  await sendMarkdownMessage(\`\`\`\n${output}\n\`\`\`);
} else {
  // Large output: preview + spoiler
  const preview = lines.slice(0, 15).join('\n');
  const full = output.slice(0, 64000);
  
  await sendMarkdownMessage(\`
**Preview:**
\`\`\`
${preview}
\`\`\`
<details>
<summary>Full output (${lines.length} lines)</summary>

\`\`\`
${full}
\`\`\`
</details>
  \`);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean chat interface
- User controls detail level
- Handles large outputs gracefully
